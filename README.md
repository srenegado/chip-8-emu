# Chip-8 emulator

An emulator/interpreter of [Chip-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) built using C and SDL2.

Play a whole bunch of retro games or even some modern community-made Chip-8 games!  

## Dependencies
https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/Installation

## Usage

To build the emulator:
```
make
```

Load up a game and have some funs.
```
./main games/super_cool_game.ch8
```

## TODOs
Extensions if I ever wanted to implement them:
- [ ] Add Super-Chip support
- [ ] Add XO-Chip support
- [ ] Add configurability for different platforms (Chip-8 / Super-Chip / XO-Chip)
