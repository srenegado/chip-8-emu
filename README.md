# Chip-8 emulator

An emulator/interpreter of [Chip-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) built using C and SDL2.

## TODOs
Extensions if I ever wanted to implement them:
- [ ] Add Super-Chip support
- [ ] Add XO-Chip support
- [ ] Add configurability for different platforms (Chip-8 / Super-Chip / XO-Chip)
